Welcome to my homepage!

I'm currently finishing my PhD studies at the University of Alicante. My research is mostly focused on trying to understand the inner workings of neural networks, mechanistic interpretability and its applications. Before getting into deep dearning/ML I got a physics degree. During that time I discovered ML and loved the combination of programming/math/problem solving abilities.

You can also find me at [GitHub](https://github.com/jgcarrasco), [X](https://x.com/jgcarrasco42), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jgcarrasco/), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=48GgM40AAAAJ&amp;hl=en).

## projects

- [Unsupervised Ink Detection with DINO](https://github.com/jgcarrasco/dino-ink-detection): Work done for the [Vesuvius Challenge](https://scrollprize.org/) to detect ink from carbonized scrolls. Currently, we have a lot of unlabeled data (terabytes of x-ray scan data from scrolls) and very little labeled data (manually annotated ink), so the idea is to develop AI techniques to take advantage of these large amounts of unlabeled data. 

- [baccpropagation](https://github.com/jgcarrasco/baccpropagation): Simple neural network implemented in C

## random ideas/facts

- Neural Networks as mechanisms of compression. Now everyone can easily have a compressed copy of the internet on the weights of an LLM.
- Importance of "back-of-the-envelope" calculations.

## cool things/projects

- [Tinygrad](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad) is a cool deep learning framework. The main philosophy behind this project is to keep it simple so that it is easy to add new accelerators. We need chips designed to run neural networks, and the main current bottleneck is software. Adapting a framework such as PyTorch to a new chip would be extremely hard, which is what Tinygrad tries to solve.

- The [Vesuvius Challenge](https://scrollprize.org/) is an ML competition to read ancient carbonized scrolls found at Herculaneum. A small piece of epicurean text has already been recovered, showing that it is actually possible to read the scrolls, but there's still a lot of work to do (e.g. automatically unrolling and flattening the scroll, techniques for detecting ink, writing documentation etc.).

- The [Recovering Overthinker](https://www.instagram.com/recovering.overthinker/?hl=en) publishes philosophical and psychological content mostly applied to fully living your life. Their posts really made me think and I have discovered lots of interesting topics to read and learn about.
